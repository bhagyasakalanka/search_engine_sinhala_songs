RAN MONARUN LYRICS

Ran monarun ranga denu dutuwa..
Nil diya matha mahanel dutuwa..
Mal uyane bamarun dutuwa..
Obe daase sanasuma dutuwa..

Kanda udnin sanda paayala..
Enna wage dan raa weela..
Inna sinahawen saraseela..
Yanne kese dan wenweela..

Mage ahdawatha thula atha pathiri..
Oba gana sithuwili yai ithiri..
Jeewithayehi mini keta mathuwi..
Samada imi mama oba sathuwi..
