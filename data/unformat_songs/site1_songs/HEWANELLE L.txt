HEWANELLE LYRICS

paluwa tanikama thuran karannata
arunalu kanda ma weta enne
kath kauruwath nati mage loketa
oba pamanai taniyata laga inne
hewanalle…….//

sapatedi ma laga tutuwana se
vipatedi na hara da yanne
yana ena hama tana taniyata ena nuba
palu danena ra na laga inne…..
hewanalle…….//

adurata ida di ma hara yana nuba
wenataka koi do ai saga wenne
rayak epa nuba natinam taniyata
dawasa pura diniduni payanne
hewanalle…….//
