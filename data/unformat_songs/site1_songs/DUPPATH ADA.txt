DUPPATH ADARE LYRICS

As ridenakan bala
Hitha ridenakan sitha
Maa obata pem kala
Mulu hadin pem kala
Nohengi se inne ai
Duppath da mage aadare
Duppath da mage aadare

As deke ellila oya hithe
Petalila unnata pathumak thiya
Hithabiyen golu wela
Kiwwetaka hera yaida ma
Nethi weida mithudam ape
Duppath da mage aadare

thanikame thani wela
Ma sithin pem kala
Wenakekuge nam wenna epa
Obamai mata mawu kena
Kiw witaka hera yaida ma
Nethi weida mithudam ape
Duppath da mage aadare
