NUMBA SITHATA PAMINI DA SITA LYRICS

[Numba sithata paminida sita ..Nethu dakinu risi e ruwa
Sitha thavama bala hindee ..Numba Adath pamina nathuwata] //

Aruna Gevi gos natha
Dan Andura Uda voowata
Numbata hakiya pera lesama
Yali Eliya ragena ennata

Sitha Dakina Nithara E Ruwa
Netha Kalak nodaka hitiyata
Ada nathath hetath me Lesa
Numba Nisa bala himi mama///
